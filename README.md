## About
Now, we have many kinds of computers. Their OS are Windows, Mac and Linux. On smart phones, they have iOS and Android also.
But the games we want to play can usually work on Windows only.
We were always thinking "that's inconsistent".
And development environments are also inconsistent.
For example, I like Linux and Mac than Windows, but I must use Windows when I make a game for Windows.
We should be creative. The work we must do is not to find Windows' bug, but to create a new fun game.

## Developers
The developers are high school students.
